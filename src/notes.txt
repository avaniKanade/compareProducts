Fixes Done:
1) Comparison tool is a feature of the shopping page. That should not be the heading.
2) CompareBar no longer belongs at the bottom of the main page. Removed.
3) "Comparison View" is from developer's termninology. Just say "Compare Mobile Phones".
4) images folder fixed for unused image and added pixel7. Deleted other images folder.

Todo:
1) Close comparison button should clear the compare list and return to Products.
2) Make all images same size and smaller to look better. Use a resizer tool.
3) Include image on compare page. Will look better. See samples on flipkart.
